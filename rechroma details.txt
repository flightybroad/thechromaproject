Re:Chroma
-------------------------
The way the game works is on Steam, if you get the main Chroma, you also can get the additional file titled Re:Chroma.


It's like how you have to get Undertale if you also want the OSTs on Steam.
(The OSTs for Chroma and Re: will be on Bandcamp but also Steam as well in the respective formatting.)


Re:Chroma, when inserted in specific game folders, can alter the scenes in some ways.

It might give you more time you can spend with the Representatives/Aspects, or a new character perspective.
I think it should be another perspective or a new game mode that lets you play the past, before *it*.


Call it Re:Chroma? Maybe something else, that title sucks.

Maybe it should be released as a separate game, and not this sort of file.
