Everyone lives in a "region" or a "district".
Each district has a general "aspect" to it.
Such as Mind, Hope, and others.


The colour of each aspect determines the eye colour of the residents of the corresponding area,
how they act, and their daily life.
There are also the "burned" who have absolutely no colour in them. Not even grey.
The Burned have lost their colours or their Chroma.
The aspects give the area its "chroma" or "life".
A "representative" embodies the "chroma" of the district.
You, as the player, aren't really from a district.
You came from the Other Place.


There are two general routes one may take.
You can restore the chroma back to the world and let it live a bit longer,
or you may take all the colours of the world for yourself, and end everyone's suffering.
Due to the nature of the plot, either way could be fine.
Depends how you justify it.
It's really fine either way.


The way the game works is on Steam, if you get the main Chroma, you also can get the additional file,
like how Undertale and its OSTs must be bought together on Steam, or you can't get the OSTs.
The file, when inserted in specific game folders, can alter the scenes in some ways.
It might give you more time you can spend with the Representatives, or a new perspective.
I think it should be another perspective or a new game mode that lets you play the past.
Call it Re:Chroma?
Maybe it should be released as a separate game.
